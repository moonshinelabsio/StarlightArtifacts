## Game Mechanics:

### 1. Augmented Reality Exploration:

Leveraging the latest in AR technology, players visually discover and collect in-game resources directly overlaid onto their real-world environment. There are no maps; your surroundings are the game world.

As players traverse different environments, unique resources become available, enriching their scavenger hunts.

### 2. Crafting Tools and Devices:

Harvested resources can be combined to craft tools, each offering distinctive abilities or revealing secrets about the game's lore.

Crafted tools can enhance scavenging capabilities or unlock special game features.

### 3. Unique AR-First Interactions:

**Starlight Artifacts** thrives on its AR-first approach. By integrating digital treasures into real-world settings, the game offers unparalleled immersion.

Players can physically walk, look around, and interact with the augmented resources, making the scavenger hunt feel tangible and real.

### 4. Wallet Connectors and Digital Assets:

For a seamless experience, players can connect their digital wallets to log into the game, ensuring safety and security.

Each resource and crafted tool is represented as a unique NFT, assigning it a specific digital identity and value.

When resources are discovered, players receive unique IDs, converting these finds into on-chain assets. Crafting utilizes these NFTs, consuming them to manifest new, crafted item NFTs.
